Binary coefficient v1:
user 2d array 
suitable to calculate all the values between the n & k
can be used when we need to get more than one value within the given limit 

Binary coefficient V2:
uses 1d arry(hence reduces the memory required for computation)
faster processing
return required number 

Recursive:
requires more time( due functin calls) and memory (stores the state of the functin at each function call)
more complex when the input is large
