look-up table:
1. uses 2D array for lookup table.
2. access time is in the order of O(1)..(constant)
3. space and time complexity to form table is O(n^2)


Square root decomposition:
table is 1D array.
table stores the minimum value of perticular range.
access time is in the order of O(sqrt(n)).
O(sqrt(n)) space complexity.
disadvantage: search is posiible only if the given index completly cover the  lookup table .
